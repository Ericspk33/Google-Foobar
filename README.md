My [Google-Foobar](https://foobar.withgoogle.com) Challenges from 02/13/21 - Present  

## Level 1
### [Challenge 1 (theCakeIsNotALie)](1\)%20theCakeIsNotALie)
\
This challenge was decently easy, however I did overthink and try to use some unnecessary methods. However we got there at the end.  

## Level 2
### [Challenge 1 (numbersStationCodedMessages)](2.a\)%20numbersStationCodedMessages)
\
Prefix Sums question, converted the array to a prefix sums ArrayList.

### [Challenge 2 (heyIAlreadyDidThat)](2.b\)%20heyIAlreadyDidThat)
\
Used a HashMap and actually was quite easy, although it did look a tiny bit scary at the start. Converting and subtracting in different bases turned out much easier than I thought.  

## Level 3

## Level 4

## Level 5
